    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A traditional finnish-style salmon soup is delicious for all seasons.</p>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>skin-on salmon</li>
        <li>leek</li>
        <li>potatoes</li>
        <li>carrots</li>
        <li>fresh dill</li>
        <li>cream</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>allspice</li>
        <li>fish stock or water</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the skin from the salmon and cut into largish chunks. 
            Remove any small pin bones and discard. Reserve the skin.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a soup pot and saute the leeks for 
            10 minutes, or until nice and soft.</li>
        <li>While the leeks are cooking, put 5 cups of water and the 
            reserved fish skin in a saucepan and bring to a boil, turn down the 
            heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Note: if you are using fish stock 
            you can skip this step.</li>
        <li>Strain the broth and add to the pan with the leeks, along with the potatoes, 
            carrots, and half of the fresh dill. Cook for another 10 minutes, or until 
            the potatoes are just tender.</li>
        <li>Add the salmon chunks to the soup along with the cream and allspice, and 
            gently simmer on low heat until cooked through, just a few minutes. Add the 
            remaining dill, and salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
